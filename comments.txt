The main thing I want to comment on is that you use a double rectangle and diamond in the diagram, but the assignment said we should strictly follow the notation used in the lecture notes, and I saw no double lines there. Instead, things like weak entities are represented with bold lines. I also saw that you put job title as an attribute of the works relationship, so moviperson works job titles. Personally though, I think it would make more sense if job was its own entity, since it represents a real world concept which itself could be many things, like a technician or janitor for example. <will add some more comments after my current lecture later today>
