-Firstly, I'm pretty sure that arrows depicting one-to-one/one-to-many constraints should point towards entities rather than relationships
-In regards to your Movie Person to Movie relationships, you didn't use a ISA split to divide movie people into cast and crew. The lack of this component allows all movie people regardless of whether they are cast or crew to access BOTH the "works in" and "acts in" relationship
-The "works in" relationship shouldn't be one-to-one since the assignment states that crew members can work multiple jobs and doesn't state any restrictions between crew members working MULTIPLE movies
-Similar to above, the "acts in" shouldn't be one-to-one since the only restriction is that cast members can only play at most one role PER MOVIE, there is no restriction on cast playing a role in multiple movies.
-"Customer" follows "Movie Person" shouldn't be one-to-one for the same reason as above. There's no restriction on how many movie people customers can follow.
-"Customer" prefers "Genre" shouldn't be one-to-one since multiple customers can prefer the same one genre
-I don't think there's an "id" attribute explicitly mentioned in the assignment
-"Customer" has "Session" shouldn't be one-to-one since the assignment explicitly says that customers can have multiple sessions
-I think "Session" should be a weak entity given "has session" is a weak relation.
-The double rectangle and double diamond is not notation which was mentioned in the notes
-"Customer" reviews "Movie" also shouldn't be one-to-one since it's not stated in the assignment that each movie can only be reviewed by a single customer
-You have three instances of entity1-relationship-attribute which I believe is also incorrect notation
-I don't believe you can tie the same attribute to both an entity and relation
-The "has" relation between movie and genre shouldn't be weak
-Overall most of the attributes look pretty good but make sure you understand when to have relationship constraints and weak entities/relations

-I noticed that you use a double rectangle and diamond in the diagram, but the assignment said we 
should strictly follow the notation used in the lecture notes, and I saw no double lines there. 
Instead, things like weak entities are represented with bold lines.
-You didn't split moviepersons into cast and crew members, so it is not as clear which specific
moviepersons relate to what. I think it would be good if there was something like an ISA triangle 
which shows that cast and crew are both a type of movieperson like the assignment description specified.
-I saw that you put job title as an attribute of the works relationship, so moviperson works job titles. 
Personally though, I think it would make more sense if job was its own entity, since it represents a real 
world concept which itself could be many things, like a technician or janitor for example.
-I think the way you used key constraints is overally pretty good. It is clear from the diagram that you can uniquely identify
the genres associated with a movie, the movieperson someone follows, the genre preference someone has, etc, which all make
sense.

- An ISA was used for cast and for crew but an ISA heiracrhy would mean that the two are seperate from 
each other, but a crew member can also be part of the cast as well. 
Instead replace them with a relationships for cast and for crew
- I think you can connect movie persons directly to movie. 
- I like that you attached the self-relationship on recommends since it does go both ways. 
- Used the bolded lines thats good. 
- The spacing of everything looks good as well and its pretty easy to understand.
