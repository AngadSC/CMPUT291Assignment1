-I noticed that you use a double rectangle and diamond in the diagram, but the assignment said we 
should strictly follow the notation used in the lecture notes, and I saw no double lines there. 
Instead, things like weak entities are represented with bold lines.
-You didn't split moviepersons into cast and crew members, so it is not as clear which specific
moviepersons relate to what. I think it would be good if there was something like an ISA triangle 
which shows that cast and crew are both a type of movieperson like the assignment description specified.
-I saw that you put job title as an attribute of the works relationship, so moviperson works job titles. 
Personally though, I think it would make more sense if job was its own entity, since it represents a real 
world concept which itself could be many things, like a technician or janitor for example.
-I think the way you used key constraints is overally pretty good. It is clear from the diagram that you can uniquely identify
the genres associated with a movie, the movieperson someone follows, the genre preference someone has, etc, which all make
sense.

- An ISA was used for cast and for crew but an ISA heiracrhy would mean that the two are seperate from 
each other, but a crew member can also be part of the cast as well. 
Instead replace them with a relationships for cast and for crew
- I think you can connect movie persons directly to movie. 
- I like that you attached the self-relationship on recommends since it does go both ways. 
- Used the bolded lines thats good. 
- The spacing of everything looks good as well and its pretty easy to understand.
